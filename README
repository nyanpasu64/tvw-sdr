Linux userspace driver for TVW750 devices (currently only the TVW750USB/TVW750U).

The data returned in the USB ISOCH packets is ITU-R BT.656/VIP formatted.  The
ancillary data, 16 bytes per frame line, contains the FM audio when tuned to a
FM station.  `aplay -f cd extract.bin` plays the audio with slight static.
This leaves, however, 168.5MB of 170MB unaccounted for in my short sample.

`./isoch isoch.bin | grep -v ' 00 00 00 00 ' | cut -d ' ' -f 14-29 | xxd -r -p > extract.bin`

In order to generate easily readable packet traces, use the provided XSL:
* capture a trace under Wireshark
* disable (sub)protocol dissection (esp. PPP)
* File -> Export -> as XML - "PDML" (packet details) file...
* $ xsltproc -o cap.txt docs/ati_wireshark.xsl cap.xml
* $ sed -i -e '/^[RW] | $/ d' cap.txt
* $ perl docs/ati-readable.pl cap.txt > cap-readable.txt
* $ perl docs/ati-array.pl cap.txt > cap-array.txt

The firmware files will not be hosted in this repo until I receive permission
from ATI/Broadcom/whoever owns the rights to them.  To generate them, do the
following:
* download the Windows driver
* Copy CTRLT507.s3 and gtatinavrr.sys to extract-firmware/
* Go to extract-firmware/ and `cargo run`

Build and run:

- autoreconf -i .
- ./configure
- make
- ./src/tvw_sdr
